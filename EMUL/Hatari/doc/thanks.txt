Following people contributed ideas or helped to find bugs in Hatari etc.,
so we'd like to say thank you here (listed in random order - and if someone
is missing here, please remind me!):

- Anders Eriksson (Evil/DHS): Helped improving STE's emulation by
  running many tests programs and providing the source code for some
  non-working demos.

- Douglas Little: wrote and run some test programs for 030 cycle
  accuracy and FPU, tested & gave feedback on Hatari CPU & DSP profiler
  features, debugged Hatari DSP emulation issues.

- Roger Burrows: EmuTOS maintainer, reported bugs in several areas
  including I/O memory access & TT emulation (timer-C, video).  Ran
  some test programs on real hardware and wrote some test programs
  himself.

- Vincent Riviere: EmuTOS maintainer, reported bugs about GEMDOS HD,
  TOS ROM handling, 32-bit IDE transfers, bus error fault in 24-bit,
  Debian bugs on Hatari Python UI, debugger enhancement suggestions.

- Jean Louis Guerin (DrCoolZic): 'Panzer' program, very useful
  for testing some FDC behaviours and timings on real hardware and to
  compare them with the emulated system. Also wrote some nice docs on
  WD1772 and methods commonly used for games' protections.

- George Nakos : Helped to track down a bug in the GEMDOS HD emulation.

- Pieter van der Meer : Traced a bug in the VIDEL emulation.

- nash67: tested hundreds (!) of games from various CD compilations
  and reported the non working ones on atari-forum.com. Huge thanks for
  that tedious work, it helped tracking down some less common cases
  not used in demos (keyboard, joystick, FDC, tos, ...).

- Jorge Cwik (Ijor): creator of Pasti STX disk image. Reverse-engineered
  some decapped STF chips (GLUE, MMU, Shifter) and many low level description
  of the STF inner work, very useful to improve emulation accuracy.
  Also wrote a Verilog Blitter matching the STE's real blitter, which helped
  fixing the complex cases of xcount=1 and nfsr=1 in Hatari's blitter.

- Paulo Simoes (ljkb): made some of the first descriptions of wakestates,
  as well as documenting all positions where hi/lo and 50/60 switches
  can create specific lines' length.

- Christian Zietz: recovered many original ASIC schemas for Atari's chips
  and helped in reverse-engineering the behaviour of those chips (MMU address
  decoding). Blitter test program.

- Matthias Alles : He initiated the port of Hatari to MiNT and helped
  with a lot of technical questions about the ST.

- Steve Kemp : Found some possible buffer overflows.

- Alexandre Rebert : Debian bugs on Hatari command line option
  handling crashes.

- Michael Tautschnig : Debian bug on ConfigureParams handling issue.

- Markus Fr√∂schle : blitter test results from real Falcon.

- Andrea Musuruane (Hatari Fedora package maintainer) :
