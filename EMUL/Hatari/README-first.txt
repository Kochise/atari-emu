This is a binary release of Hatari for Windows. Hatari is an Atari ST,
STE, TT and Falcon emulator with a focus on high compatibility.
Emulation can still have issues - so feel free to report
problems if you find any. Please refer to the files in the "doc"
subdirectory for more information about Hatari in general.

This binary release ships with EmuTOS (the file "tos.img"). EmuTOS is
an open source TOS clone licensed under the GPL. Please visit the
official EmuTOS page (http://emutos.sourceforge.net/) for more
information and for obtaining versions in other languages or the
source code.
However, if you want to play games or watch demos, you should better
use an original TOS ROM image since many games and demos do not work
very well with EmuTOS yet.
