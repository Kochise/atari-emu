Things to do eventually
-----------------------

Fix bugs:
- "-d" cmdline option doesn't work (doesn't win over config file settings)
- [ETHx] update with DNS IP address (requires FreeMiNT update)
- don't store empty config entries (ETH2,3,4; DISK2,3,4,5,6,7; HOSFSA-Z, ..)

TODO in keyboard support:
- loadable keyboard layout (similar to hatari)
- editable keyboard layout (need WYSIWYG - impossible in 320x200)

TODO in TOS patches and utilities:
- automatic updater of BDCONFIG.SYS
- separate mouse driver from Clocky and make it NatFeat based
- finish and publish TOS XHDI disk driver

Some hot ideas (before they get forgotten)
------------------------------------------

Note that the name before a TODO item doesn't mean the item is assigned to
that particular programmer but rather who is author of the idea :-)

- Petr: make.sh magic: "nfeth-config.c" build by ./make.sh of the xif.

- Petr: write some doc about bridging the tuntap - perhaps the following
       URL could help?
       http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Ethernet-Bridge-netfilter-HOWTO-3.html#ss3.1

- Petr: extend the config file routines to save also some comments above
  each head section. Example:

  # the following section defines hotkeys. Format is 
  # hotkey = keycode : modifiers
  # where keycode and modifiers are defined in SDL_keysym.h
  [HOTKEYS]

- Milan: SIGINT ndebug problem solution

- Milan: --with-opengl-prefix

- STanda: hostfs.cpp: enable debug and implement all NOT IMPLEMENTED needed
         methods.

- patrice: rework dsp thread synchronization. It seems it may hang sometimes.

- patrice: C++-ize the input layer, get rid of various keytables hacks.

- patrice: fvdi aranym.sys driver (m68k side) must follow the host surface
  R,G,B,A organization.
