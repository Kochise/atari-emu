General (all platforms) known bugs:
-----------------------------------

Bug: PureC cannot open project file on host filesystem.
Reason: A MetaDOS related bug in PureC.
Solution: Patch your PureC with supplied patch.
--
Bug: Programs started from MetaDOS HOSTFS sometime crash.
Reason: A MetaDOS bug in its Pexec implementation.
Solution: Forget MetaDOS and use BetaDOS 3.12+ instead.
--
Bug: Videlity Configure Tool does not work (hangs during launching)
Reason:
  Dirty delay loop - while(clock() == certain_value). This may not work
  even under multitasking system and does not work in current ARAnyM where
  TimerC interrupts come in pairs (100 Hz host interrupt) unless RTC
  source clock is used.
Solution:
  General solution is to get a more precise host timer interrupt (at least
  200 Hz, with the Linux RTC). Specific (and suggested) solution is to stop
  using Videlity and replace it with BlowUP030 or something similar.


Platform dependent known bugs and limitations:
----------------------------------------------

MacOS X does not like floating videoram. Compile with --enable-fixedvideoram.
Calling SDLGUI in fullscreen mode does crash the program anyway.

Windows 95/98/99/00 do not support direct disk access (Windows NT/2K/XP do).
This is a limitation of Cygwin, or rather a limitation of the windows itself.

Only Linux-ia32 (x86), MS-Windows and Solaris (x86) currently support JIT
compiler for the CPU emulator. This is not a design limitation or a bug
in other operating systems, it's just lack of manpower willing to work
on JIT support for the other systems.

User ids, group ids and device types reported by HOSTFS are those used on
the host and are not converted to the corresponding MiNT values.
