Question:

  I would like to contribute to the development. I wanted to use CVS but
  it's read only. What can I do?

Answer:

  Create a diff file using the following command:

    "cvs diff -u >cvsdiff.txt"

  Then mail the cvsdiff.txt to pstehlik@sophics.cz.

Question:
  I copied my mint setup on ARAnyM. It may works if I can use
  long file names and access rights. Should I use a new disk
  image for that ? How would I build one?

Answer:
  if you have a working setup on Atari and want to have the same
  on ARAnyM, follow these steps:

1) if you want to use the disk directly, simply take it from your
   Atari machine and put it to your host machine (be it PC, Mac or
   whatever, we don't care). Set up the drive in .aranym/config, e.g.

   [IDE0]
   Present = Yes
   Path = /dev/hdc
   Cylinders = 2100
   Heads = 16
   SectorsPerTrack = 63
   ByteSwap = No

   The "Path" point to the physical device. /dev/hdc is master on
   secondary IDE channel (ask someone if you don't know what I am
   talking about).

   The "Cylinders/Heads/SectorsPerTrack" values maybe either written on
   the disk label or in your hard drive utility (e.g. HDDRUTIL) - but
   only if it's an IDE drive. ARAnyM also tries to guess the values,
   if you set one from these values to -1 (supported only for real
   devices, only under Linux today).

3) if you want to leave your original disk in your original Atari and
   use just a copy of that disk then create a disk image:

   On Atari you can use anything that allows you to store the whole disk
   drive into one file - e.g. Diskus. Naturally you need a second
   harddrive with more free space than is the size of your disk you are
   creating the image of). Then you have to copy the image to the host
   somehow.

   On the host (PC, Mac, ...), in Unix like OS you can create the disk
   image with as simple command as:

   dd if=/dev/hdc of=/home/aranym/disk_image bs=1M

   For windows you may want to try out a "WinImage" (use download.com?)
   
   For configuring ARAnyM see the 2) above, the Path now points to
   the /home/aranym/disk_image. The "Cylinders/Heads/SectorsPerTrack"
   are needed to be set to correct values. In case you are not sure
   then go to the /proc/ide/hdX/geometry (applies for Linux only)
   where X depends on what drive you are creating the image from and
   use the values in the line starting with "physical" word respectively.
   Beware of the hdparm utility which gives you only the "logical"
   C/H/S which is not really what you need.

   Note: if the image has been created on Atari, you have to set the
   ByteSwap IDE ARAnyM option to "Yes".

4) start ARAnyM and enjoy. Everything should work as expected. However,
   if you were using some special HW drivers, like e.g. Afterburner,
   Centurbo or NOVA/Rage gfx card drivers, you want to disable them.
   So try the first boot with Ctrl held down (AUTO folder programs are
   not executed then).

Question:
  The GEMBench Blitting test crashes/hangs every time I run it using fVDI.

Answer:
  Put the following line into your FVDI.SYS:

    xbiosfix

  GEMBench is not really good benchmark program for ARAnyM anyway.
