1) Compilation requirements
---------------------------

For compiling ARAnyM you will need libSDL, version at least 1.2.10.
You can get it from http://www.libsdl.org/ or from your OS distribution vendor.

If you want to compile source fetched from Git you also need
automake, libtool and autoconf (http://www.gnu.org/ or your OS vendor).

Supported platforms:

All Debian GNU/Linux platforms

and

x86          BeOS
x86          GNU/Linux
x86          MS Windows + Cygwin
x86          OpenBSD (unmaintained)
PPC          MacOS X
SGI          Irix (unmaintained)
Sun Sparc    Solaris

In progress (in alphabetical order):
m68k         FreeMiNT
x86          FreeBSD
x86          NetBSD


2) Compilation
--------------

  2-1) Unix or Linux
  ------------------
If you got the source code from Git then type
./autogen.sh && make

If you have a source snapshot or proper ARAnyM source code release then type
./configure && make

./configure --help shows you all the compile time options.

If everything went OK you got an executable file named "aranym".


  2-2) Microsoft Windows
  ----------------------
Compilation is accomplished using the Cygwin linux-like environment
(http://www.cygwin.com/).

Details are available in tools/build-cygwin.txt.


  2-3) Apple Mac OS X
  -------------------
Go to src/Unix/darwin folder first.

If you got the source code from Git then just type
make

If you want to configure ARAnyM for your personal needs, type 
../configure_ppc --help

Add preferred options to the CONFIGURE_OPTIONS_ppc and CONFIGURE_OPTIONS_i386 
variables at the top of Makefile inside the darwin folder. After that run make 
again.

If everything went OK, you got an executable named "ARAnyM.app" inside the
src/Unix/darwin folder.

This application expects its default configuration inside the current user's 
~/Library/Preferences/org.aranym.amcfg file. Inside that config file a path 
beginning with */ will be expanded to ~/Library/Application Support/ARAnyM.

The ARAnyM.app also supports virtual machine bundles: Put all your disk image 
files, host-fs destination folders, ROM image etc. and a properly configured
org.aranym.amcfg file into a new folder. Give that folder the extension 
".ARAnyM" or ".amvm". The Mac OS X Finder will then treat this new Folder as a 
so called bundle. Just dubble click on it and ARAnyM should start and use it.

To modify such a bundles content, in the Finder Control-click or right-click on 
it and select "Show Package Contents".   

There are also other methods of building ARAnyM for OS X. Refere also to the 
documents inside src/Unix/MacOSX.

  2-4) FreeBSD (i386)
  -------------------
If you got the source code from Git then type
MAKE=gmake
./autogen.sh && gmake

If you have a source snapshot or proper ARAnyM source code release then type
./configure && make

./configure --help shows you all the compile time options.

If everything went OK you got an executable file named "aranym".

3) Installation
---------------
You may install ARAnyM on Unix/Linux by typing 'make install' (have root
privileges as default configuration installs to /usr/local/),
or you may run the binary directly by typing ./aranym.

Next step is to obtain the operating system (TOS 4.04 or EmuTOS) and install
a harddrive. More on this in the README file. Easiest is to download
one of the 'afros' disk images (Aranym FRee OS) that contain everything
preinstalled.


4) Troubleshooting
------------------

If you compiled libSDL by yourself and installed to /usr/local/ you might
experience the following problem when running autogen.sh:

aclocal: configure.in: 835: macro `AM_PATH_SDL' not found in library

The fix is relatively easy:

export ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I /usr/local/share/aclocal"

This helps aclocal to find the .m4 file and everything is fine then.
