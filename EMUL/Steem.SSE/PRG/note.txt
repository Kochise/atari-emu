This is the folder where Steem will copy as 'AUTORUN.PRG' standalone PRG files
(zipped or not) that you want to directly run.

If TOS 1.04 -> 1.62 is selected, the program will be run using the DESKTOP.INF
method.
With other versions, the AUTO folder method is used.

You must set up a Z: harddrive pointing to this PRG folder.
