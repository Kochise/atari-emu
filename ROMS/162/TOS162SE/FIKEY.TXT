================================

Installation of Norwegian keyboard:

  To get Finnish keyboard copy the program FIKEY14 (16) to the autofolder.
  Use FIKEY14 for TOS 1.4 and FIKEY16 for TOS 1.6.

Error statements:

  FINNISH KEYBOARD DESIGNED FOR TOS 1.4

    The program you have executed only works with TOS 1.4
    
  FINNISH KEYBOARD DESIGNED FOR TOS 1.6

    The program you have executed only works with TOS 1.6

  FINNISH KEYBOARD MUST BE IN AUTOFOLDER

    This program must be in the autofolder to work. Make a folder with the name
    AUTO and copy the program into this folder. Restart the computer and the 
    program will be executed automatic.

  FINNISH KEYBOARD INSTALLED TOO LATE

    This program is a replacement of the keyboard driver in the computer. To 
    make shure that it works with all other programs it demands to be executed
    before other programs that changes then same system vectors. To be shure of
    that you must first clear the autofolder of the programs which changes the
    same system vectors and then copy FIKEY14 (16) into the autofolder. Then 
    copy the progams back into the autofolder. If you don't know which programs
    that changes the same system vectors then just clear the autofolder totally
    and copy FIKEY14 (16) into the autofolder and the copy the programs back.
    All this sounds more complicated than it really is ! You just have to know
    that the programs in the autofolder is executed in the order which they are
    copied into the folder.
    


Technical details:
  
  The program installs a new keyboard driver, by altering the systemvektor
  ikbdsys. The new vector is installed by means of the XBRA standart. The 
  identification is SCKE (Scandinavian keyboard). The reason for demanding
  to be installed at first is that unfortunately not all programs stick to
  the XBRA standart. One such program is Atari USA's program maccel2.prg 
  (mouse accelerator). By demanding to be installed first it makes shure that
  it works with 99.99% of all other programs. Of course it can't work when
  other programs installs their own keyboard driver but then again the keyboard
  driver in the rom would not either. The program is written in assembler and
  occupies 2 kb of memory.
