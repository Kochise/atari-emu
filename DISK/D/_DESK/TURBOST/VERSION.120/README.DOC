TURBO ST  Copyright 1988 Softrek
Version 1.2   August 18, 1988

Thank you for purchasing Turbo ST, version 1.2.  Version 1.1e, which is
also supplied on your disk, is provided as a courtesy to users of Easel
ST.  Use of this version is required if you want your background picture
to be displayed.  To use this version, simply copy the file inside the
folder labeled "VERSION1.1E" to any disk you start your computer with.
Please note that this version is not quite as fast as version 1.2, since
it does not include our fast fill rectangle routine.

The following are the known limitations of Turbo ST, version 1.2. If
you encounter a difficulty not referred to on the list, please report
it.  We do listen and we may able to correct it before the the
next release.

1) It is recommended that ProCopy be used only when Turbo ST is turned
off.  Apparently, speeding up the sector write status display, can throw
off the internal timing of ProCopy when it is copying a disk.

2) Using ST Writer with Turbo ST on a color monitor will produce a
slightly compressed screen, since ST Writer directly changes the line
spacing (unfortunately, there is no standard escape sequence for this).
Other than that, ST Writer will function properly, though much faster.

3) Some programs directly change the TOS font pointer to allow the
monochrome screen to display 50 lines using the 8x8 system color font. 
In addition, some programs directly change the TOS font to emulate
another type of terminal. This will result in a garbled display, but
it shouldn't crash your machine (simply turn Turbo ST off).

4) When starting up GFA BASIC in low resolution, the hardware register
that controls screen resolution is apparently changed directly.  Since
Turbo ST does not see this, the screen display is garbled.  If GFA BASIC
is started in medium or high resolution, it works fine.

5) A few control sequences may not always operate properly.  It has
been reported that within the Mark Williams C Shell, control characters
are not echoed to the screen by Turbo ST, and that within the HiSoft
GENST editor, the output does not pause when Ctrl/S or Ctrl/C is pressed.
Other than that, both programs should work well, although in most cases 
much faster with Turbo ST.

6) The accessory used to access the Atari laser printer, SETUP630.ACC, 
only works properly when the Diablo 630 printer driver, DIAB630.PRG,  
is installed after Turbo ST.  Otherwise, the SETUP630 accessory says  
the Diablo printer driver needs to be installed, even though the laser 
printer prints fine.

7) Due to the way GDOS changes workstation handles, it is impossible
to ensure 100% reliable operation with GDOS installed.  In general
you should have no problems, but the following has been reported:
Timeworks Desktop Publisher and Microsoft Write will not print text
to the laser printer and the Beckmeyer MT C-Shell and the SEDT editor
will crash.  With the GDOS replacement, G+Plus from CodeHead Software
(P.O. Box 4336, North Hollywood, CA 91607), we should be able to achieve
100 percent reliable operation in the future.  By the way, if you want
to run GDOS from the desktop instead of from the auto folder, you should
first remove Turbo ST, run GDOS, and then install Turbo ST again, other-
wise the system may crash.

8) It has been reported that dBMAN will not load with the Ztime desk
accessory and Turbo ST installed.

9) There is no way to insure total compatability with all public domain
programs, as some of these programs do things in an unorthodox manner.
Please use these unusual public domain programs with caution.
