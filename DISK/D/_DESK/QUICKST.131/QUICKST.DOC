Hello from World Of Atari!

Quick ST now supports the Diablo emulator, G+Plus, and the Hyperscreen
monitor. Quick ST can run as a desk accessory (QUICKST.ACC) or as a
program once the desktop comes up (QUICKST.PRG). It uses about 32K of
memory, and speeds up text output and GEM operations.

The speedups are more efficient in monochrome, but we are working on updates
which will speed up color as well.

This version of Quick ST also displays the amount of free memory available,
as well as the TOS version of your computer. In case you discover any bugs,
report them to us and be sure to include the TOS version of your computer!

Quick ST is now also compatible with Font Tricks, and other font loaders.

This version of Quick ST is just slightly faster than before. The main
advantages are that is it now compatible with just about any desk accessory
or TSR. 

Quick ST and this text may be copied and distributed freely by modem or
disk. No fee other than the download charges or cost of the disk may be
charged. That means _you_ BRE!

A shareware contribution of $20 would be appreciated if you use this program.
If you don't use it, tell us why. If it's a bug, let us know about it. The
next Quick ST update is planned for sometime in July.
