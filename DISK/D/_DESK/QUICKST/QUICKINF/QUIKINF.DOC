Documentation for Quick Inf 1.3
===============================
(C) 1989 by Darek Mihocka and Ignac Kolenko


Quick Inf runs on any ST, color or mono, with TOS in ROM.


Quick Inf - the Desktop Information Editor
------------------------------------------

Quick Inf is a program developed primarily to allow the user to change the
desktop window directory search masks. The inability to change the masks
from the desktop is probably one of the worst deficiencies in the desktop.
Lets say for instance you wanted to backup all *.C files on the currently
displayed window for drive C. Right now, you have to go to the menu bar and
sort by type, then position the slider bar in the window so that it will
show the *.C files inside the window. This is an incredible pain for backing
up files, to say the least, and is one area where the Atari ST lags behind
the IBM! (in MSDOS, you simply say COPY *.C ...)

But now, the Atari ST can have this ability easily with Quick Inf.

To use Quick Inf, double click on the file QUIKINF.PRG. A dialog box will
appear, and the screen colors will change to white, black, red and green
(on a color monitor only!). The current desktop information will appear in
the dialog box. The first editable field is one of the (up to four) windows
that are on the desktop currently. By clicking on the number beside the 
field, you can scroll through the different windows currently open. If the
field cannot be edited, it is because there were no windows open at the time.

The next few lines pertain to editing the application information. The arrows
obviously scroll through the different applications currently installed. Add
allows you to choose a new application (the FULL path is remembered, unlike
the desktop's install application feature). Kill allows you to delete an 
entry from the list of installed applications. The next button allows you to
choose the type of application it is: GEM, TOS or TTP. If you click on the
application name, you can re-edit the path from which that application is
called. Finally, if you edit the mask, you can allow different files to be
called for different applications.

A small button with a drive letter, with an editable field next to it
displays the current name for that drive icon. This is a very convenient
method of editing the names of the drive icons. Finally, the name of the
trash icon will appear, and is also editable. Clicking "Exit" will inform
the desktop of the edits made in the session, and these changes are
permanent until you rerun this software, or alter the desktop yourself.
Clicking "Cancel" will leave the session and the desktop untouched.

If you click on the "Curr" button, the dialog box will revert to the current
values before any editing. If you click 'Load", you can load a DESKTOP.INF
file into memory for editing. When you exit, the desktop will use the loaded
desktop information instead of what it was before running this option. If
you decide not to use the loaded information, simply press "Curr", and the
old information will re-appear. Clicking "Save" will allow you to write out
the current information in DESKTOP.INF file format.

Finally, you can install QUIKINF.PRG as an application. It will check the
commandline for a parameter, and load it as a possible *.INF type file. This
way you can simply click on a DESKTOP.INF file whenever you want to change
it!

Quick Inf 1.3 is the latest version of this program. We have new
features in the works, such as complete control panel and printer options,
and vary the mouse rates and keyclick rates.

At this time, we would like to receive some user feedback before we go
ahead and implement any new features. What else you you like to see in our
"super desktop inf editor"?

Quick Inf updates will come in two versions. Versions 1.xx will be released to 
the public. Quick View and Quick Print versions 2.xx will be available 
to people who have sent the $30 shareware registration fee. We expect to 
have the first such updates ready during the summer.
