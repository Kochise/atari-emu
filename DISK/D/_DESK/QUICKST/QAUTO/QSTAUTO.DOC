Quick ST 1.46
=============

(C) 1989 by Darek Mihocka and Ignac Kolenko

Quick ST 1.46 is a shareware release of Quick ST and may be copied
unmodified by Atari ST users to give to other users, uploaded to the
online services Compuserve, GEnie, Delphi, and BIX, uploaded to Usenet,
and distributed by Atari ST user groups for no charge other than the cost
of the disk. It may NOT be sold by any dealer or organization which sells
public domain software by mail order.

This is a special release of Quick ST 1.4 which is intended to be
installed in the AUTO folder. Why? There are a number of advantages of
this method, including the fact that no desk accessory slots are used up
and the amount of memory used is much smaller (less than 16K).

To use the desk accessory version, which is more configurable, download
Quick ST 1.4 (dated July 7, 1989) from the Atari ST libraries of
Compuserve, GEnie, Delphi, or BIX.

Quick ST 1.46 is intended for use in medium resolution or monochrome. Low
resolution is not supported to save code, since most applications (not
including video games), do not run in low resolution. Video games usually
bypass GEM, and so Quick ST would have no effect on them.

What does Quick ST do? It hooks itself into TOS and looks for all screen
operations, such as printing text, drawing lines, scrolling the screen.
When this is detected, Quick ST performs the screen operations itself
(much faster than TOS), and the result is that the screen appears faster.

Screen scrolling becomes roughly 30% faster, and printing text to the
screen can be up to 4 times as fast. Windows and dialog boxes pop up and
disappear faster. When used on a Mega ST equipped with a BLiTter chip,
Quick ST has even more of a speedup effect.

Quick ST is compatible with the Hyperscreen modification for monochrome
monitors. Instructions for this small hardware upgrade have been posted on
the online services, which increases the resolution of the ST monitors.

This version fixes a bug in Quick ST 1.4 which caused some text editors to
actually run slower. A good example is ST Writer. With version 1.46, ST
Writer is now up to 50% faster at screen scrolling. With Quick ST 1.5, it
is up to 100% faster.

This version of also supports color text, for use with programs such as
Phasar and ST Writer in color, and better supports inverse text when used
on a Hyperscreen monitor in monochrome.

To install Quick ST, simply copy the file QSTAUTO.PRG to the AUTO folder
on your boot disk (or partition C: on a hard disk). If an AUTO folder does
not exist, create one first. The order in which Quick ST loads from the
AUTO folder is not too critical. When used with Easel ST or Bigscreen, it
makes no difference which loads first.

Quick ST now supports most versions of GDOS. Up until now, it has only
sped up G+PLUS, which is still supported. When used with Atari GDOS, we
found that it was more effective if Quick ST loaded after GDOS, but try it
both ways just to make sure.

To rearrange the order of your AUTO folder programs, copy all the files
from the AUTO folder to some other disk or folder. Then delete all the
files in the AUTO folder, then copy them back in the order you wish them
to load in. We recommend putting programs such as AUTOTIME, TEMPLMON, GDOS
and DESKMNGR first, followed by the remaining programs.

We received some reports of Quick ST not working properly on very early
Mega STs due to the TOS ROMs being at a different memory location. We have
tested this release of Quick ST on every release of TOS including TOS 1.4
on disk, and found it to be compatible.

A few people also reported that with Quick ST 1.4 loaded on a 520ST, Word
Writer did not have enough memory to load the spell checker. Although we
haven't been able to test it with this release, since it only uses 16K
instead of 35K, it may help out Word Writer and programs like it that are
short on memory.

There are a few known incompatibility problems remaining. Someone has
reported a problem with Word Perfect's print spooler which we have not
been able to reproduce yet, and there is a problem with Interlink's type
ahead buffer. Monochrome 520STs and 1040STs may show some white lines when
dragging the mouse on the desktop. This is not a serious problem and is
caused

Please report any other problems. Remember to include the model of your
ST, the type of monitor, the version of TOS, and which desk accessories
and AUTO folder program were in use.

Please contribute to shareware. Quick ST 1.5 is available along with 6
other Quick Utilities for $30, which is cheap compared to the price of
commercial software. Send a check for $30 US ($35 Canadian, or equivalent)

or call (519)-747-9452 for more information about the other Quick
utilities. Quick ST 1.5 was released this week to registered users, and
includes separate color and monochrome AUTO folder, desktop, and desk
accessory versions. Quick ST 1.5 is also up to 50% faster than this
release. Although Quick ST is written for the benefit of all ST users, to
save everybody the hassle of getting a BLiTter chip or 16MHz accelerator
board, we do expect to get shareware registrations from people that use
our software.

We had hoped to have a head-to-head comparison of Quick ST and the
commercial package Turbo ST 1.6. The disk has not arrived yet, but we do
know that Turbo ST 1.6 uses roughly 50K of memory (ouch!) but is faster
than Quick ST 1.5 in some cases. That's why development of Quick ST is
continuing.

For version 1.6 of Quick ST, we will include a smart loader to
automatically load the correct version and throw away unneeded code, and
the Quick ST Executive, which is a Control Panel like desk accessory which
enhances Quick ST and adds some extra commands to the operating system
which will be used by the other Quick utilities to save memory.

We would like to thank all the people on Compuserve and GEnie who have
reported bugs and served as testers. We would also like to thanks Charles
Johnson and John Eidsvoog of Codehead software for providing information
about G+PLUS, and Keith Gerdes of Double Click Software for helping to
find all the bugs in the Hyperscreen support. One of our 520STs will soon
go under the knife for the Hyperscreen operation to ensure that Quick ST
is compatible with all future releases of the Overscan software. Also, many
thanks to Thomas Tempelmon for discovering a rare crashing bug in version
1.45.
