STARTGEM.PRG is a public-domain program by R. Flashman. This is the latest
version, and runs with all Atari TOS ROMS. Put it as the last program in an
AUTO folder (that is, it is the last one you copy into the folder). STARTGEM
will then look for the file STARTGEM.INF in the root directory of that disk,
which contains the path/name of the program to automatically run.

STARGEM.INF is currently set to run QUICKR_2.PRG from the root directory of
drive A:\.
