WHAT IS QUICKRUN?
=================

      If you have a hard drive, you've probably got your files organized into
different partitions and directories. While that's really neat, it can be a
real hassle : Either the program you want is nested seven folders deep, or you
have to scroll through dozens of data files to find it.

      QuickRUN is a program manager -- You build lists of ST programs, which
can then be executed from QuickRUN instead of the Desktop. It doesn't matter
what the program is, if it's a legal ST TOS program, you can run it with
QuickRUN. And since QuickRUN is only 18K, it doesn't eat up your memory.

      Imagine, just click on FLASH.PRG, and let QuickRUN find it for you!
Stick all your games in one list, and run them together conviently! Put your
editor, compiler, linker, debugger, assembler, and other tools all in one list,
and avoid hopping between windows, folders, or drives. Or use QuickRUN with the
"Universal Item Selector", put ALL of your ST programs in a list, and use
QuickRUN as an alternate Desktop!


STARTING QUICKRUN
=================
      To get started, run the file QUICKR_2.PRG. This is a GEM-based program,
so you'll have to either run it from the Desktop, use the auto-execute feature
of TOS 1.4, or have STARTGEM run it for you automatically (see elsewhere in
this archive for information on STARTGEM).

      QuickRUN will try to load the file QUICKR_2.RSC. If it is not in the
same drive/directory as QUICKR_2.PRG, the program will not load.

      If there is a file called DEFAULT.QRL in the same drive/directory as
QUICKR_2.PRG, it will be automatically loaded in.

      When QuickRUN is ready, you'll see the main dialog box. There's a
scrollable window on the left, and a bunch of buttons on the right. Everything
in QuickRUN is activated by a button, which activates a command :

  HELP    -- QuickRUN help and information.
  ADD     -- Adds a new program to QuickRUN.
  EDIT    -- Update an existing entry.
  CLEAR   -- Gets rid of one entry, or the entire list.
  ORDER   -- Alphabetizes all entries for ease of searching.
  LOAD    -- Loads a QuickRUN list.
  SAVE    -- Saves the current QuickRUN listing to disk.
  RUN     -- Executes the currently selected program.
  QUIT    -- Leaves QuickRUN.

      You can run a command by either clicking on the button, or pressing the
first letter of that command on the keyboard.

      You can scroll through the list with the arrows/scroll bar, or by
pressing the up/down arrow keys. Pressing the arrow keys by themselves will
scroll the list by one name. Pressing the arrow keys with the SHIFT key held
down will scroll the list in increments of 20.

      You can select a file to operate with, by clicking it with the mouse, or
by pressing F1 - F10 (for files numbered 1 through 10) or SHIFT and F1 - F10
(for files numbered 11 through 20).

      For all commands, information is provided either by a dialog box on the
screen, or a "what-you-should-do" line at the top of the screen.


QUICKRUN COMMANDS
=================

      ADD lets you put a new program into the current list. With the ST file
selector box, click on the program you want to add. When you actually run the
program with QuickRUN, it'll use the path (drive and directory nesting) you
specify here.

      EDIT will let you update a listing entry. Click on the filename you want
to update, then click on EDIT. You can then use the file selector box to choose
a new filename/path for that entry, just like with ADD.

      CLEAR gets rid of listing entries. If you have no filename already
chosen, CLEAR will allow you to clear the entire list currently in memory. If
you do have a filename chosen, you can either clear the entire list or just
that one entry. 

      ORDER will alphabetize the QuickRUN list currently in memory. Once a
list is alphabetized, there's no way to "un-alphabetize" it, so be sure you
want to do this.

      LOAD puts a new QuickRUN list into memory. Loading a list will get rid
of anything you already have, so be careful! Only QuickRUN-generated lists can
be loaded; any attempt to load an illegal file will be cancelled.

      SAVE writes the list currently in memory onto the disk. If you have
nothing in the list, the command is ignored. Any filename can be used for a
QuickRUN list, but if no extender is specified, ".QRL" will be automatically
tagged on.

      RUN will execute the currently selected file; this will work exactly as
if you had run it from the GEM Desktop. If the program is not in the
directory/path it's suppoed to be (as specified with ADD or EDIT commands),
QuickRUN will not run it.

      QUIT leaves QuickRUN. Anything you have in memory will be erased, so be
sure to SAVE your work first.


WHAT ELSE IS THERE?
===================

      To tell the truth, there's not much else I can think of to say about
QuickRUN. All of the commands are obvious, and there are warning prompts
before anything disasterous can happen.

      The only limit to how many programs you can have in a QuickRUN list is
the amount of free memory you have. If QuickRUN doesn't have the memory for a
new entry, there's probably not enough memory left to execute anything anyway.

      QuickRUN works with the "Install Application" feature of the ST Desktop.
If you use this feature in conjunction with DEFAULT.QRL, the file you selected
will be loaded, and not DEFAULT.

      This program is completely free, but I really, REALLY, *REALLY* want
some user feedback! Drop me a postcard or something at the address below, so I
know that SOMEBODY is actually seeing these things I write. I don't care if you
have nothing to say, just write SOMETHING. It really makes my day to know that
someone actually read this file, and not just skipped over it.
