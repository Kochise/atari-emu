Quick ST 1.4 Documentation
==========================

by Darek Mihocka  07/07/89


This release of Quick ST is available in 3 flavors: the standard version
which runs on both color and monochrome, a monochrome-only version, and a
color-only version. The purpose of having resolution dependant versions
is to allow users with only one monitor to save memory. The standard version
must support both color and monochrome, so at any one time it is really
using only about half of its code. What we hope to have soon is a version
that will automatically load the correct code, and eliminate the need of
having three versions.

Quick ST replaces some parts of the ST's operating system (known as TOS)
which deal with screen operations with more efficient code. Part of the
problem is that a large portion of TOS is written in C language, and not
machine language, whereas Quick ST's code is all machine langauge. The
result is that screen operations such as printing text, scrolling the
screen, popping up windows and dialog boxes are faster. Quick ST has been
optimized heavily for monochrome monitors, but it will also speed up color
monitors to a lesser extent. Future versions will have more optimized
color code.

Quick ST can be used in one of two ways: either as a desk accessory or as
a terminate and stay resident (TSR) program. Both methods accomplish the
same task, although when run as a TSR it may be slightly faster. To run it
as an accessory, take the QUICKST.ACC file and copy it to your boot disk,
usually drive A: if you boot from a floppy or drive C: if you boot from a
hard disk. To run it as a TSR, rename the file to QUICKST.PRG and double-
click on it after the desktop has come up. It can be run from the desktop
at any time, and saves you the trouble of rebooting the machine.

The separate color and monochrome versions are called QUICKSTC.ACC and
QUICKSTM.ACC. They work in exactly the same way except they will only run
on one monitor. If you have a two monitor system, you should use the
standard version.

Quick ST is compatible with most other desk accessories and TSRs. It can
be used with Codehead Software's G+PLUS desk accessory to speed up screen
operations even more. Also from Codehead is a program called Font Tricks,
which allows you to load DEGAS fonts to replace the system font. Quick ST
is fully compatible with this.

Quick ST is compatible with the Hyperscreen modification for monochrome
monitors. Instructions for this small hardware upgrade have been posted
on the online services, which increases the resolution of the monochrome
monitor to 800x500 pixels.

When used as a desk accessory, the fast GEM and fast text options can be
disabled in situations where the speed increase is not desirable, or with
programs that cause problems with Quick ST. One such program is called
FSELV55.PRG (a replacement file selector) and it was found to be
incompatible with most other accessories too. If you experience problems
when running terminal software, simply turn off the fast text but leave
fast GEM on.

Quick ST is shareware. We would like each and every ST user to use it,
because it is a useful utility. If your ST still has TOS 1.0, once you try
Quick ST you'll realize how slow your computer was all this time. But we
do expect you to send in the shareware contribution if you use Quick ST.
A new update disk of Quick ST and the Quick utilities is going to be mailed
out to registered users in about a week, and will not be uploaded to the
services.

Currently we have 3 shareware packages available:
    Quick ST [$20]
    Quick Utilities (Quick ST and 6 other utilities) [$30]
    ST Xformer 2.5 (130XE emulator) [$20]

For printed information about any of the above packages, write to me and
I'll mail you the appropriate information.

Shareware versions of ST Xformer and the Quick Utilities can be download
from online services like Compuserve, Delphi, and GEnie. If you have them
please distribute them to other ST users and bulletin boards. When you
send in a shareware contribution, you become a registered user and will
receive the update disks along with printed documentation. The mailing
address is:
    Darek Mihocka
    Box 2624, Station B
    Kitchener, Ontario N2H 6N2
    Canada

Make all cheques or money orders payable to Darek Mihocka, and please
print clearly so we can mail you the disk to the correct address.

Two phone numbers are available in case you have any further questions.
I can be reached at (519)-747-0386 for matters relating to ST Xformer or
Quick ST, and Ignac can be reached at (519)-747-9452 for questions about
all the Quick Utilities.

The Quick Utilities released as shareware so far are:
    Quick ST - speeds up screen operations (.PRG and .ACC)
    Quick View - very fast text file viewer (.PRG)
    Quick Find - perform file searches and file operations (.PRG)
    Quick Index - benchmark the performance of your ST (.PRG and .ACC)
    Quick Inf - load, save and edit DESKTOP.INF files (.PRG)
    Quick Label - label editor and printer (.PRG)
    Quick Print - creates fast text screen dumps (.ACC)

We think you'll agree that these 7 programs are certainly worth the $30.
There are a few more in the works, including one that converts .PRG files
to desk accessories. For example, you can run ARC Shell as a desk accessory,
and if you have the memory, even ST Xformer 2.5 runs as an accessory. The new
programs will be released on future update disks for registered users only.

If you have any questions of problems, call or write to us. If you want to
leave email, I can be reached on the following:
    Compuserve: 73657,2714
    GEnie: DAREKM
    Delphi: DAREKM
    BIX: darekm

and Ignac can be reached on Usenet at watmath!watcgl!electro!ignac or at
ignac@electro.com (whatever that all means!).

Finally, I enjoy demoing this software to user groups and at computer shows,
having done just about every user group within a hundred miles of Toronto.
I will be staying in Seattle for a few months soon, and would be interested
in attending user group meetings in the area (Vancouver or Portland too). So
give me a call and let me know where and when you meet.

Enjoy Quick ST! Additional information about ST Xformer can be found in
back issues of ST LOG, Current Notes, and Computer Shopper magazines. Look
for articles about the Quick Utilites in the near future.
