Quick Index 1.5 is an update to Quick Index 1.4, and has a couple of
new features. Two new categories have been added to benchamark the
efficiency of outputting text strings, and to benchmark screen scrolling
speed.

The other new feature is the ability to change the reference system.
In earlier versions of Quick Index, the reference used was a 520ST running
in low resolution. This didn't help a user with a monochrome monitor much
because it didn't tell him how his system compared to another monochrome
ST system.

Quick Index 1.5 has 6 built-in references: TOS 1.0 in a 3 resolutions,
and TOS 1.4 in all 3 resolutions. For example, to see how your ST compares
in speed to say, a monochrome 1040ST (which has TOS 1.0), click on the
button marked 1.0 and on the button marked Mono. Then click on the Do All
button.

A slight change from Quick Index 1.4 is the way in which a single benchmark
can be performed. In version 1.4 you had to deselect the other categories.
In this version, simply click on the category name to run the test.

The categories are divided into two groups. The first group (in the
top half of the screen) contains benchmarks which are relatively independent
of TOS version or screen resolution. The second group is very dependednt,
since these are the screen output tests, and so choose the reference 
system carefully.

Some of the categories have been recalibrated, and so the numbers may
vary slightly from before. For example, the dialog box used in the
GEM test has been changed to include a wider variery of objects. The
BIOS text test has been changed to use all 80 columns if possible.

The categories test three major areas of the ST: disk I/O, screen
output, and CPU speed. The CPU results should always return 100% if your
ST is not equipped with some sort of 16MHz accelerator board or cache.

With about half a dozen companies now claiming to have 16 MHz accelerator
boards for the ST, we would like to see some more results. We challenge the
makers of these boards to run Quick Index on their hardware and show us
some pleasing numbers before we shell out $300 to $500 for such boards.
We'd like to see numbers in the 150%-200% range, and not less!

The screen output benchmarks can be used to see how effective programs like
Quick ST, Turbo ST, and GDOS are, and can also be used to test the blitter
chip performance.

The disk benchamarks test how fast the selected disk drive can be read,
how fast it can create files, and how fast the disk drive spins. The
results will partly be affected by how the disk is formatted (i.e.
single sided, double sided, twisted, etc).

We hope that you will find Quick Index useful. Remember to support
shareware by sending us a contribution of $30. You then become a registered
user of all of the Quick programs (Quick View, Quick Index, Quick Find,
Quick Inf, Quick Print, etc...) and will be able to receive updates that
will not released to the public. Click on the HELP button in Quick Index
for more information.

This release of Quick Index may be copied, and this documentation file may
be reprinted, on the condition that the program and documentation are not
modified and are distributed at no cost. The ARCed file may be posted on
any free BBS or online service.
