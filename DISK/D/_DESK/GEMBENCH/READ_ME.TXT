GEMBench documentation is now in ST-Guide hypertext format. Please install
ST-Guide as a desk accessory or run ST-Guide.APP and load GEMBENCH.HYP.

Please report any errors or problems with GEMBench.

Known Bugs:

* The Close All command in the Window menu can cause confusion,
  although GEMBench will not crash. This is OS dependent. I will fix
  this as soon as I can.
