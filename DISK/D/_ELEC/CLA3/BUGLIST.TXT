CLAv3 : KNOWN BUGS
===================

Here's a list of bugs I know of in CLAv3

1) The Simulator
Whilst simulations are running you can still edit designs. Unfortunately,
this means that at the moment you can delete gates (or even load in a
new design) - which will confuse the simulator mightily and probably
crash the program. Non-destructive editting is OK (moving gates about,
adding new wire links and new gates) - the problem only occurs if you
delete a gate that the simulator is using.

2) The Editor
There is a bug in the editor that causes CLA to crash occasionally. I don't
know what it is, and it only shows up occasionally, so I'm having problems
finding it.

3) Hierachical IO Connectors
If you rotate an external H.IO connector, it's internal representation
will rotate as well.

4) The auto-router.
Quite a few problems with it, mostly to do with failing to route correctly
unless you use the finest resolution (which takes ages to work out the
routes). This is unavoidable, so I suggest that you use manual routing
unless you have a fast machine. The auto router is great if you are using
CLA on a Mac Quadra with MagicMac....but a bugger on a standard ST.

5) Geneva.
For some reason, the colour icons don't work with Geneva. I'm almost certain
this is a problem with Geneva itself, as they work fine with a falcon,
AES4.1, or even MagicMac....they only fail with Geneva. If you really feel
that you must run CLA with Geneva, do it in mono - that works fine.
(I don't like Geneva myself, it seems very unstable compared to AES4.1
or MagicMac).

6) General
Lot's of the dialogs don't appear to do things - this isn't a bug, it's
just that I haven't finished all the features I've designed for yet.
