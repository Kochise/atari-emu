Here's a short description of the example schematics:

3IPAND.NET      - Simple 3 input AND gate.
BLOCKTEST.NET   - Demonstration of block structuring.
CCTD.NET        - The simple circuit shown in the manual.
DFLIP.NET       - The same complex implementation of a DFLIP-FLOP.
DF_TEST.NET     - The DFLIP element actually wired up.
FULLADDR.NET    - Two bit binary adder with carry.
MUL_TEST.NET    - The 3bit parallel multiplier connected up ready for
                  testing.
MULLER-C.NET    - Complex implementation of the Muller-C element
                  used in high speed CMOS design to create self
                  timed circuits.
PRIM_DF.NET     - Example using the D-Register primitive instead of
                  the complex implementation.
SIGANAL.NET     - Signature analysis register as used for built in
                  self-test applications.
SIM_RES.NET     - Demonstration of how simulation resolution can affect
                  results.
