Welcome to CLAv3.....

Well, ok here it is (as far as I've got). Version 3 of the
CLA Digital Electronic design system.

This is a full un-restricted release, complete with most of the
associated tools (FSM editor, VHDL compiler, etc).

With any luck, a few people will send me some money for this...it may
encourage me to finish it :)
