NET2NET (20/7/94)
==================

This program converts the older (v2r1/v2r2/v2r2a) file format into v2r4 format.
Give it the filename as a parameter (type it into the TTP dialog, or drag a
.NET file onto it). This format has some changes for use with CLAv3, but
is still compatible with all versions of CLAv2.

It will load the file, then save it in the new format.

What This Program Changes
==========================
1) External Inputs
The changes in file format are to do with EXTERNAL INPUT handling, and unfortunately
mean that all external inputs (those which would appear in the word generator) will
be deleted, and will require putting back in by hand. This patch is only applied
to older files (v1r2/v2r2) and will not change v2r2a files at all.

2) Wire Links
If you have already used net2net on a file, only the required changes will be
made to bring the file up to v2r4 spec. This will fix the bug when moving items
which caused wire paths to be corrupted. The wire link patch is non-destructive,
so you should be able to use the file again straight away, and it will appear to
be exactly the same (but, when used with CLAv2r3, the MOVE function will no
longer mess up wires).

3) Hierachical IO ports
Some CLAv2 designs have an error in the wires connecting internal & external
hierachical IO ports. This causes CLAv3 to crash when performing deletes on
h.i/o's. This patch fixes the problem.
