Enhancer is an auto folder program, written by the Behne brothers
which gives the same off-screen bitmap VDI extensions hat are
provided by NVDI 2.5 (v_opnbm(), etc). Enhancer is freeware to
encourage people to use these extended calls.

CLAv3 makes use of the extended VDI calls if possible (it works
without, but is slower), so I've included Enhancer with it in case
anyone doesn't have NVDI (but why wouldn't you?).

Stick it in your auto folder and forget it. Most programs won't
speed up at all (it's not a replacement VDI like NVDI is), just
ones that know how to access the extra features it provides
(ie. CLA).

Please note however that Enhancer does NOT work with SpeedoGDOS,
and will cause CLA to crash if used at the same time. If you
want CLA to go fast & use Speedo fonts, then get NVDI3.
