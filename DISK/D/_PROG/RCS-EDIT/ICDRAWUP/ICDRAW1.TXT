       "Wowee- what a spiffy-keeno little computer this Falcon is.
     Sure wish I could have some different icons for the desktop."
     
       I said that over a year ago, in February 1993 when I first
     powered up the Falcon. Time has past and still no sign of any-
     thing that fits the bill.

       After a common fit of complaining about this and about that 
     (we US devs do that a lot;-), I decided I'd sit down and write an
     icon editor myself. But... Other projects took up my time. I still
     kept an eye open for news of an icon editor or something akin to one. 
      More months have come and gone and I'm still locked into using the
     same icons as a year ago.
     
       Like several of my programming projects, this was designed out
     of frustration. That old adage, "If you want something done right,
     do it yourself" kept humming in my mind as I delved into what 
     scant documentation was available for version 4 resource file
     extensions and hammered out a Resource Viewer. With that I was
     able to pinpoint exactly what and where the color icons were and
     what format they were in and what that pseudo-C sample code was
     trying to say. 

       From that comes ICDRAW.
       
       But before we get too involved in ICDRAW's biography, let's
     take a moment to review a remedial step in this wide wonderful
     world of computing:

      **************************************************************  
                   KEEP A BACKUP of your important files.
      **************************************************************
         In this case we're talking about DESKICON.RSC. And, for
         your convenience, backup the NEWDESK.INF along with it.
      **************************************************************  


       Ok, let's get back to our main story. When we last saw Dr. Bob
     he was being held captive by the evil princess and her amazons
     in the jungles of ... whoops! Sorry, wrong story.

       
       There are some things you should know about how TOS4 works
     before you start editing away:
     
       TOS 4 reads a file called DESKICON.RSC when it powers up. In
     this file, among other things, are all the color and mono icons
     that can be displayed on the desktop. TOS only reads this file
     when it starts up (at power-on or after a reset). Any changes
     made to the DESKICON.RSC file will not take effect until the
     Falcon is reset.
       TOS 4 determines which type of icons to use by checking the
     video resolution.  Mono icons are used for all mono modes and
     for 4-color modes.  The 16-color icons are used for all modes
     with 16 or more colors  (ie 16-color mode, 256-color mode and
     32k-color modes).

     
     Unlike the normal mono icons, color icons are twin icons. The
     first icon is what you normally see on your desktop. The second
     is the 'selected' mode of the icon- it's displayed when the
     icon is selected (officially called 'animation' [I just love it])
     But you already know this- you've seen it on your Falcon.
     
      Desktop icons are 32x32 pixels... today. Tomorrow they may be
     larger but I have no need for larger icons today and there is
     no documentation that says, one way or another, whether todays
     desktop _can_ or _cannot_ handle larger icons.
     
      The DESKICON.RSC file is theoretically capable of storing 4,
     8, and 16 plane icons (even more... theoretically). As it comes,
     with the Falcon, DESKICON.RSC contains only mono and 4-plane
     icons. TOS converts these 4-plane icons for use in 8-plane modes
     and for true-color modes. They work quite well too!
      Some may claim that 256-color icons would be a big feather in
     anyone's cap but on a 16MHz machine, I'll skip the feathers-
     thank you very much ;-)
     
      DESKICON.RSC can also hold gobs of icons. As it comes with the
     Falcon, there are 33 from which you can choose (notice the lack
     of a dangling preposition;).

     
      ICDRAW fits into those parameters. It can read a version 4 RSC
     file and can edit any of the color icons found within. It does
     NOT offer to ADD icons to the file nor to delete icons from it
     (use RSC-XPAND for that).
     It edits only icons that are the normal 32x32 pixels (both mono
     and 4-plane [16-color] icons).
     
       To avoid any other compatibility issues, ICDRAW uses only the
     VDI routines for drawing/editing. You'll notice the redraw time
     is lengthy... well... lengthier than my normal custom editing
     routines... thank the VDI for that, not me ;-)

      
       update:  to speed up the fat-bit display, direct video writes
                have supplanted the older vdi vr_recfl routines in
                ICDRAW and have dramatically reduced the time needed
                to redraw the displays. So much so that I can't go
                back to the old way.

     *****************************************************************
      The standard caution: SAVE A COPY OF YOUR ORIGINAL DESKICON.RSC
      file before you modify it.  If you later decide that the old
      original icons better suit your needs then... you'll have them.
     *****************************************************************



      With ICDRAW v1.3, a menubar is used. Many buttons have disappeared
      from the edit dialog and now reside only in the menus.
      
             
      ICDRAW starts up in edit mode.
      
      EDIT mode:
      
      Two large cells are displayed that will hold the icon and its
      mask in a "fat-bit" or "zoomed" form.
       
      A 16-color palette is available from which to select pen colors.
      
      Three buffers are readily available for editing, two for color
      and the last for mono. They are imaginitively labelled  MAIN, 
      SELD and MONO. 
      
      A fourth buffer is used for copy/paste functions (it holds both
      the icon and its mask).
      
      Since, when you first run ICDRAW, there are no icons in any of 
      the buffers, you'll see none on the screen (wow! this is smart.)
      
      The lower left corner holds various common icon editing functions
      such as clear mask/icon, fill mask/icon and cover mask. There are
      also the standard flip, flop and rotate functions.
      (as of v1.3, their location has moved but their functions remain)
      The arrow buttons scroll... left, right, up or down by one pixel.

      (is this getting boring?)

      
      Ok, let's move onto the big red buttons:
                      ... and the blue buttons
                      ... and the green buttons
                      ... and the little teeny tiny grey buttons
                      ... and the slightly red but still grey buttons
                      ... (enter own Pythonish phrase here)

      Ohoh! The 'big buttons' are now gone. All file i/o is done via
      the menus, including import/export, load/save, loadrsc,saversc,
      grab/put and the new load_paste.

                            ICON EDIT DIALOG:
                            *****************

      RESOURCE FILE  Icon Extract/Replace
      -----------------------------------
      
     (All file in/out routines are from the menu selections)
     
      GRAB <- RSC:    Will extract a set of icons from the desired RSC
                      file (if none is selected then the file selector
                      is provided). All three icons of the group are
                      placed into the edit buffers (Main,Seld,Mono).
                      Once a RSC file is loaded, it is retained in memory.
      
      STORE->RSC:     Will allow you to put the icon(s) back into the
                      RSC file. The labels 'MAIN SELD and MONO' are
                      active and indicate which icons will be stored.
                      Usually, you'll want to store all three but if
                      you want to only store one then you can de-select
                      these buttons, writing only the desired icons
                      back to the RSC file in memory.
                      Point and click to the set of icons to be
                      replaced with your newly edited ones.
                      Once the icon is stored, you'll be placed back
                      in GRAB mode, ready to select another icon to edit.
                      If you want to continue editing the same icon,
                      simply select cancel (ie [EDIT]).
                      (Alt-Click on [STORE->RSC] will return to edit mode
                       once the icon is stored without the need to click
                       on cancel in the resource dialog.)
                       
      LOAD DESKICON:  Provides direct LOAD and SAVE of the DESKICON.RSC
      SAVE DESKICON:  file. After loading a deskicon.rsc file, you'll
                      remain in the resource dialog... ready to pick one
                      of its icons for editing.
                      If no resource file was loaded, you will not be able
                      to SAVE DESKICON (of course)... even though the menu
                      item still shows as if it is active.



      ICON(s)  Save/Load/Export/Import
      --------------------------------

       SAVE ICON:     Save the currently selected icon (MAIN,SELD or
                      MONO) to a diskfile for later use.
       SAVE GROUP:    Save all three icons (Main,Seld and Mono) to a
                      disk file for later use.

       LOAD ICON:     Load a single saved icon (from disk) into the
                      currently selected buffer (MAIN,SELD,MONO). 
       LOAD GROUP:    Load a group of three icons (as saved above).
       
       LOAD PASTE:    Will load an IBI (ie single icon) file into the
                      paste buffer... this can save effort instead of
                      loading an icon, copying it to the paste buffer
                      and then loading another icon or group for
                      editing.

       EXPORT:        Allows you to save single icons (and its mask)
                      to a disk file. Options let you export the icon
                      to either an assembly source file (both icon and
                      mask data and both with their own MFDBs) or to a
                      binary version in either the standard format or the
                      device specific format of MFDBs.
           (v1.2)      A binary CICON structure can also be exported.
                      This format is identical to that used in the
                      extended section of the DESKICON.RSC file.
           (v1.2)      Exports current icon/mask to a Microsoft Windows
                      ICO icon file. The Falcon's colors may not be an
                      exact match for Windows colors (particularly the
                      'darker' colors but they will be close to the Win
                      defaults).
                       Version 1.41 fixes a bug in the constructed ICO
                      file. The height specified in the DIB heading is
                      now doubled to 64 (instead of the expected 32).
                       
                      Note:
                       'Device specific' indicates a video style format.
                       'standard' indicates separate contiguous planes.
                       If these terms confuse you then export an icon
                       to both assembly source formats and view them.
                       You'll see the difference in the way the image
                       is stored. One is directly blit-able to a 4-plane
                       video screen. The other has each plane stored
                       separately.
                      Note:
                       In each export form, the mask is stored in its
                       single plane or mono format (the MFDBs are set
                       this way too... of course).

       IMPORT:        Only one import format is implemented in v1.2,
                      the ICO Windows icon file format.
                      This is preliminary and will only import the
                      standard 766 byte ICO files with the correct
                      header information (ie 1 icon, 32x32 pixels,
                      and 16 colors... all presumed 'important colors').
                      The RGBQUADS of the ICO icon are ignored (this
                      _is_ a preliminary;-) and the default Window
                      colors are used. 
                      note: You may witness a slight difference in the
                            'darker' colors when importing ICOs.




      EDIT Tools
      ----------

       COPY:          Copy the current icon (and mask) to the copy/paste
                      buffer. Below the 'COPY' button, you'll see the
                      icon that is now ready for pasting.
       PASTE:         Take the icon (and mask) from the copy/paste buffer
                      and paste it into the current icon (and mask).
                      * see notes on pasting a color icon to a mono icon.
      
       FLIP H:        Flip the icon and mask Left-to-Right.
       FLIP V:        Flip the icon and mask Top-to-Bottom.
       ROTATE:        Rotate the icon and mask (on its center) by
                      90 degrees, CCW.

       (arrows):      Scroll the icon and its mask 1 pixel, up, down,
                      left or right.
       
       COVER:         Use the pixels in the icon to build a mask.
                      Any non-white pixel found in the icon has its
                      cooresponding pixel in the mask set to black.
                      Likewise, all white pixels in the icon set the
                      mask pixels to white.
       OVERLAY:       Similar to COVER but only sets colors. White does
                      not erase a bit in the mask.
       .AND.          Use MASK as a mask <grin> to block-in the icon image.
                      Any pixel in the icon image that is not covered by
                      the mask will be erased.  
       (mask)
       CLEAR MASK:    Set all bits in the mask to white (ie no mask).
       FILL MASK:     Fill all bits in mask with black (ie solid mask).

       (these have been relegated to the menu bar only)
       FILL ICON:     Fill all bits in icon with black (ie black square).
       CLEAR ICON:    Set all bits in the icon to white (ie no icon).
       CLEAR BOTH:    Erase both icon and mask (ie neither).



       v1.1           Version 1.1 introduced the following items:
       
       ECHO:          Echo icon pixels in the mask. Gives a representation
                      of the icon's pixels in the mask display, letting you
                      easily see which mask pixels 'should' be set to black.

       GRID:          Displays a grid of points in both the icon cell and
                      the mask cell, showing the exact pixel boundaries.

       CHG:           Allows you to change one color in an icon to another.
                      A new dialog pops up over the icon cell and offers
                      two color palettes. One for the color to be changed
                      and one for the color it should be changed to.
                      (drat- another dangling preposition)
                      note:
                      Attempting to change a color to itself confuses _me_
                      but ICDRAW catches it and cancels the function ;-)

       BLK:  (v1.2)   Active only during MONO icon edit. Similar to above,
                      will change all color pixels to black. 

       SWAP: (v1.2)   Swap MAIN and SELD icons (and masks). 

       CHXY: (v1.2)   Set CHAR x,y position in Icon. Draws a marquee
                      Box that is movable with the mouse. Left click
                      to set new position or right-click to cancel.
                      
                      Use the Alt-key and CHXY to bring up the manual
                      edit mode for the parameters of the CICON header.
                      You can edit the CHAR xy, the CHAR foreground and
                      background colors, the ICON xy and the text label
                      xy.
                       At least in TOS 4.1, you must set the background
                      to 0 (white). Other combinations are not condusive
                      to a mello experience.
                      The [RESET] button will fill all the parameters 
                      with the default settings in case things get out
                      of hand.
                      The [MOUSE] button will let you use a drag box
                      to place the CHAR xy (as without the Alt-key).
                      (this info also stored in the saved icon files)
                      
                       The char xy, need NOT be set in most icons as
                      TOS only uses it for icons assigned to a disk
                      unit (A:,B:,C:,D:,E: etc). New icons default the
                      char xy to 16,16 (icon center).  
                       Even so, the original icons found in DESKICON.RSC
                      already have their char xy set... no need to bother
                      unless you want it moved.
                       * v1.4, with its larger fat-bit display improperly
                         calculated the X,Y. This is fixed in v1.41

  GREY/WHT/BLK/PATT:  Defines the background style for the icon group
                      display (the set of 3 icons; lower right of form).
                      Allows you to view all the icons on different types
                      of backgrounds.
                      GREY is the light grey (as in the form), WHT shows
                      a white background, BLK shows a black background
                      and PATT shows a 50:50 pattern (in color black to
                      simulate mono mode but also shows an adequate pattern
                      for color patterned desktops).
                      
                       Note: Some icons will look good (even fantastic) on
                       the grey background but you'll find that many users
                       use a pattern desktop even in color modes. Try to
                       make your icon look good on the pattern background
                       or make two sets of icons. One for desktops with
                       a solid desktop background and one for a patterned
                       background.

       TOOLS: (v1.34)  Provides for more tools, less frequently used than
                       those in the main edit dialog (T is the keypress
                       equivalent).
                       
                       
            INVERT:    M RVS will invert the mask (black to white and
                       white to black).
                       I RVS will invert the icon.
                       DK <--> LT will effectively exchange the dark
                       and light colors in the icon (ie Bright red
                       becomes Dark red and Dark red becomes bright
                       red... the same for all hues)
           
            COMBINE:   FRONT will copy the icon that resides in the
                       paste buffer over top of the current icon.
                       White is not copied, only colors 1-15.
                       BACK will copy the icon that resides in the
                       paste buffer 'behind' the current icon.
                       White is not copied, only colors 1-15.
                       Only those pixels that are blank in the 'current'
                       icon receive the pixels from the paste buffer's
                       icon... in other words, as I said, it copies
                       BEHIND the current icon ;-)
                       
            INS/DEL:   INSERT or DELETE a row or column from BOTH the
                       icon and the mask. When inserting rows, the
                       bottom row will be scrolled into oblivion. 
                       Likewise when inserting columns, the rightmost
                       column will be transported to Neverneverland.
                       When deleting, the bottom row or rightmost 
                       column will be blank white.

            LINE:      Will provide a rubber-banding tool to draw a
                       line into the icon using the currently selected
                       color. The right mouse button (or esc or UNDO)
                       will cancel the operation.
                       
            FRAME:     Will provide a rubber-banding tool to draw a
                       frame (ie open box) into the icon using the 
                       currently selected color. The right mouse button
                        (or esc or UNDO) will cancel the operation.

            BOX:       Will provide a rubber-banding tool to draw a
                       a filled box into the icon using the currently
                       selected color. The right mouse button will
                       cancel the operation (as will UNDO or ESC).

            CIRCLE:    Will provide a rubber-banding tool to draw a
                       circle (transparent) into the icon using the 
                       currently selected color. The right mouse button
                       will cancel the operation (as will UNDO or ESC).

            DISC:      Will provide a rubber-banding tool to draw a
                       filled circle (ie disc) into the icon using the 
                       currently selected color. The right mouse button
                       will cancel the operation (as will UNDO or ESC).

                       Keypress equivalents are set for these tools so
                       you can call them without hassle if you want.

                                      F6:  DISC


           When editing an icon, the number keys 0 through 9 and the
         alpha keys "A" through "F" (or "a" through "f") will select
         the colors 0 through 15.

                           ***********************
                           RESOURCE SELECTOR mode:
                           ***********************
                         (GRAB <- RSC  in Edit Menu)
  
       Five groups of icons are displayed at one time. The arrows will
       scroll through the resource file (I know. I'm getting boring
       again, aren't I?).
       
       Selecting any icon will copy the group (Main, Seld and Mono) to
       the buffers of the icon editor and voila! You're ready to edit.
       
       The ascii text displayed with each icon is not editable. This
       text is stored within the resoure file but is, of course, not
       used in the desktop icon (the application name is, remember?).
       The text is displayed only for reference.


  RESOURCE PUT mode:     (from: PUT-> RSC in Edit Menu)
  - - - - - - - - -

       Similar to the selection mode, 5 groups of icons are displayed.
       
       At the top of the form, you'll see your new icons displayed
       next to the large message box.
       
       PAY ATTENTION TO THAT LARGE MESSAGE BOX! It changes, depending
       on the function to be performed (grab/put).
       
       Below each of the new icons is a little down-pointing arrow. By
       default, all three are highlighted. This means that all three 
       icons will be written to the RSC file in memory.  You can opt to
       write any or all to the RSC file by turning the little arrows
       on or off (off=white arrow, black text. on=dark arrow, white 
       text... you know, the normal on/off of all type of buttons;).
       
       Selecting any one of a group in the display box will replace that
       group with your newly edited icons.
       

notes:

     *  The third buffer is dedicated for the Mono icon of the group.
        Transparent to the user, this buffer is the same size as that
        needed for a color icon.

        If pasting a COLOR icon to the MONO buffer, the color data is
        NOT converted to mono. It will still display as color. It will
        NOT be saved as color either!
        The colors are kept and displayed for reference only. Over-
        draw the color pixels with black to ensure a good mono icon.
        (when writing it back to the resource, ICDRAW copies only the
        first plane. Some colors may or may not set pixels in the
        first plane. BLACK sets pixels in all planes).
        You can avoid the pixel-by-pixel coloring by using CHG to change
        one color to another (in this case, to black). See CHG above.
        As of v1.2, you can use BLK to set all colors (save for white)
        to black.

     *  ICDRAW uses common-sense when calling the file selector:
        o  File extensions are automatically added! 
        o  File extensions are automatically added! (intentional duplicate)
           A resource file always gets '.RSC' added.
           A saved file always gets the proper extension: '.IBI' or 'IB3'
           An export file always gets the proper file extension: '.S' '.BIN'
           'CIC' or 'ICO'.
           It is good practice to always type the correct file extension
           but with ICDRAW it isn't necessary. (ICDRAW makes it easy)
           
        o  Three path buffers are kept. One for the resource file directory
           one for the load/save directory and one for the export/import
           directory. This way, exported icons don't end up in the same 
           folder as your DESKICON.RSC file (and visca-versca, as Popeye
           would say).

           DESKICON.RSC is the default filename on powerup. No drive
           indicator is set; the current drive and path are used.

     *  The keypress equivalents for load and save of icons are NOT
        single key strokes. ALT-L or ALT-S will load or save a GROUP
        and SHIFT-L or SHIFT-S will load or save a single icon file.
        The single keypresses of "L" and "S" (or "l" and "s") will prompt
        you with an alert box as to which type of icon(s) you wish to
        Load or Save (single, group or cancel).
        The last selected type (in each alert) is remembered and is used
        as the default the next time the alert is called.
        

     *  ICDRAW is 100% assembly.
        (with a tip-o-the-hat to the folks at Hisoft)
        And now with the custom fat-bit display routines to replace
        the VDI calls, it REALLY Flies!


     *  Included with ICDRAW is RSC-XPAND, the deskicon.rsc file
        expander. It will let you increase the number of icons in
        your resource file from 33 to 50...199.
        Also included are a small collection of icons. Some new and
        some old-but-modified:
        Cityscape, Christmas, SF Com Badge, Envelope, Cash, Bullion,
        File Presser, Zipper, Ohio, Sopwith's evil twin, Button, Fuji,
        Picnic, Speed55, Yield, Ohio, Eyes, Bandaids, Meatgrinder,
        Unpacker, FileType icons, Quarter, Cherries, Address book,
        Notepad, a variety of tidied icons from the originals, a few
        extra colored disks, a few icons for specific applications and
        more (the complete list of icons in beyond the scope of this
        documentation).

Revision history: ICDRAW.prg

v1.42 05/18/94   Added:   Support for 800x600 16-color video mode.

v1.41 05/15/94   Fixed:   ICO export format now doubles height spec
                          in the DIB header (Windows presumes the icon
                          height to be 1/2 the value specified. the
                          other half is presumed for the mask).
                 Fixed:   CHAR_XY. New, larger fat-bit display of v1.4
                          was not accounted for in calculating the
                          true char x,y.
                                           
v1.4  05/08/94   Added:   Draw circle/filled circle, keypress equivs
                          for GRAB/PUT, and a general cleanup then
                          ate some Ho-Hos and was feeling great!

v1.34 05/06/94   Added:   Tidied-up new buttons and location. Removed
                          GRID/ECHO buttons (left in menubar). Custom
                          fat-bit video display (MUCH faster!). Keys
                          0-1 and a-f select colors. Fixed invert ICON
                          function in TOOLS.
                 Added:   TOOLS: COMBINE 1,2,3. INSERT/DELETE ROW/COLUMN.
                                 Invert function 3, exchange dark/light
                                 colors in icon.
                                 DRAW LINE. DRAW FRAME.
                           LOAD PASTE buffer from IBI.
                           UNDO, button/menu/key.
v1.3  04/05/94   fixed:   RSC-XPAND. Placed dialog in window to
                          alleviate wm_redraw headaches.                                 
v1.3  04/30/94   Added:   Menubar functions. Removed file i/o from
(beta)                    edit dialog. Removed CLR/FILL data from
                          same and left to reside in menu bar.
v1.2  04/25/94   Added:   Extra functions (.AND.,Overlay,Inverts)
v1.2  04/22/94   Added:   ICO Export
v1.2  04/21/94   Added:   ICO Import
v1.2  04/16/94   Added:   Window, SWAP(main/seld), goto BLACK,
                          Export CICON format, and CHARX/Y/Parms edit.
                 Changed: "HUE" button to "CHG" (change) and
                          resize when editing mono icon to allow
                          for 'goto black' function.
                 Removed: ADD-to-RSC function.
                          Created, instead, RSCXPAND to expand the
                          RSC file external from ICDRAW.
                 Fixed:   2nd load of RSC file would appear garbled,
                          now zeroes count before loading 2nd RSC.
                
v1.1a 04/12/94   Added:   ADD Icon to RSC... (experiment failed. TOS
                          requires a totally reconstructed RSC file
                          when an icon is ADDED)

v1.1  04/12/94   Added:   backdrop styles, echo, grid toggle, 
                          arrows in STORE, and color change.
                       
v1.0  04/09/94   Original release

                         ICDRAW is shareware.
 
                     RSCXPAND is a part of ICDRAW
                   (and is therefor also shareware)

  ICDRAW may be freely distributed as long as this documentation is
  included as as long as neither are modified (that includes all my
  spelling errors). It must not be represented as anything other
  than Shareware.


  ICDRAW\RSCXPAND is shareware. Try it out. If you don't care for it
  then don't waste your disk space- erase it, upload it, whatever.

  If you do like it then a small donation will keep me in groceries
  and living indoors (two serious addictions that I just can't seem
  to break).
  It will also tell me that perhaps a new version with more features
  might be appreciated.

  I can already think of new features. The ability to ADD to a RSC
  file, import icons from other formats, capture icons from the 
  screen, export to other formats... there's a lot that can be done.


 Note: I will refuse to accept more than $15.00 US as a donation.
       This is a small utility. $10.00 is suggested and $15.00
       is a good pat-on-the-back. $20.00 is right-out, I'll have
       to send you change and I can't break a twenty right now ;-)


{retrospect: "hmmmmm should I up the price?  It seems kinda low
              for all the work I've put into this... should I ask
              concientious users to make up for those more akin
              to pirates or for those who just rationalize their
              use of shareware? Should I, shouldn't I? Awww what
              the heck... let's leave it the way it is and see how
              it flies. If it falls into oblivion then it'll tell
              me just what kind of market this really is. Or that
              perhaps they're still waiting for Atari to produce 
              an icon editor.  Yeah. Right. Uh-huh. Sure. :) "
