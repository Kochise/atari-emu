                                HELP:

  Welcome to Dr. Bob's office. Please take a number and the doctor
  will be with you as soon as possible.
  
  
  
  Number 1)    What?! You didn't read the docs for RSCXPAND and now
               you can't even boot your machine?

               Tell me you DID back up your deskicon.rsc file!
               Tell me it's true!
               
               No matter. Your Falcon diskettes have a copy on
               them. Boot from floppy and copy it back to drive C:
               
               Now... let me get a shot of penecillin for you...
               (where did I put those extra large needles?)
  
  Number 2)    "I expanded my resource file to 199 icons and didn't
                experience any dizziness until I later changed
                resolution to true-color. Now my system just sits
                there with a blank white screen and a busy-bee."
                
                 Not to worry. True-color mode is slow in a lot of
                ways. TOS just needs more time to convert all those
                icons from 16-colors to 32k color format.
                 This isn't very noticable when you have the stock
                deskicon.rsc file with only 32 icons but with an
                expanded resource file it becomes obvious.
                 It takes upward of 30 seconds to convert all 199
                icons. Just wait a while longer. 
                 If this is too long a delay for you then perhaps
                you'd be more comfortable with say, 100 icons.
                Re-run RSCXPAND on your original resource file and
                select a lesser number of icons. (100,128 or even 80)
                
  Number 3)     "ICONPAGE will not run on my STe."
  
                 Unfortunately, this problem is yet unsolved.
                 Original testing was done in the ST-LOW resolution
                 'compatibility' mode of the Falcon030 and works
                 fine there. It was assumed that it would also
                 work in 'real' ST-LOW resolution... alas, that is
                 not the case. It is being looked into as we speak.
  
  
  Number 4)     "I can't get ICDRAW to run on my 520STF."
  
                 I'm terribly sorry. You want Dr. Seuss's office.
                It's down the hall on the right (don't miss it, you
                might), you'll see a grand sight.
                 He fixes all sorts of widgets and wadgets, and
                luny old gadgets, even ditties and dotties and
                little tot potties.
                 Why... he's even stayed late, as much as past eight,
                to fix up a toofering snore.


  Number 5)     "Doc! It hurts when I do this."
  
                 Ah! You've come to the right place!
                  Nurse, prepare an enema for our patient...
                  ...he's got a bad case of cliche-itis.
