                            A Paged Icon viewer

                        16 color modes Falcon or ST
                            
                               Makes a handy
                            Companion for ICDRAW

                         This ICONPAGE.PRG is free.
                           (ICDRAW is shareware!)
                      

   Display a folders worth of Falcon desktop icons (ICDRAW's IBI & IB3 
 formats). Works in 16 color modes (640x480,640x400 and even ST/320x200).

 
   Will display as many icons (in groups of three) as will fit on the
 screen, paging from that point onward if necessary to display the
 complete folder.  In Falcon 640x480 mode this will show up to 54 icon
 groups per screen page (ie arrayed as 6x9).

 This version will appear the same on the screen, no changes there, but
 the user interface is different than the original version. This is due
 to reports of screen redraw messages not being detected (and leaving a
 large 'hole' in the screen after using the file_selector), and there
 being a need to explain an interface that, although is simple, is not
 familiar to users.

 
 The MENU BAR is active in ICON PAGER and controls all the functions.
 There is no longer a need to click on the little upturned corner of
 the page to advance to the next. In fact, the cutsie little corner
 is for display purposes only now. Use the menu bar to advance to the
 next page or previous page etal, or use the key assignments shown
 next to the menu selections.
 
 ICON PAGER now lets you show the single icon files (.IBI), the group
 icon files (.IB3) or both (.IB*). 
 
 The active keypresses are also different from v1.00. Since this is
 such a simple functioning program it was felt that the space bar
 was better off as a 'NEXT PAGE' key rather than a 'REDRAW' function.

 Mouse button presses no longer perform any function as they did in
 the original version.

 A PAGE refers to a screen full of icons. If the folder you've selected
 has fewer icons than will fill a screen then there are no further
 pages and the PAGE DOWN,UP,END have no function.

 ICON INFO:        Clicking on any icon will display its details such as
                   filename, time/date of creation or last modified, file
                   size and the 'Creating Softwares' title.
                   
                   At this point, you are given three/four options:
                   
                   OK:      Quit the dialog and return to viewing.
                   
                   COPY:    Copy the icon file... using the the destination
                            path. If no destination path has yet been set
                            then you are asked for one.
                            * The file is copied, using its same filename,
                              to the path you'd selected.
                            * The file time/date is retained (of course).
                            * Existing files will not be overwritten
                              automatically. You are altered and asked
                              to confirm the over-write.

                   DELETE:  Delete the icon file from the disk. You are
                            Alerted and asked to confirm this operation.
                            File deletes are permanent (as if you didn't
                            know).

                   SET:     Set the destination path... or set a new
                  (path)    destination path for the COPY function.
                                                       



 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Notes, Hints, Tips:
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  When selecting a path in the file selector, leave the filename blank
    to read ALL icons in the folder (as per IBI/IB3/IB*).
 *  ICONPAGE accepts a command line. You can drag and drop at the desktop
    or you can install ICONPAGE as an application.
    When doing this, only the one icon file will be displayed.
 *  ICONPAGE will sit in the background when an accessory is launched until
    either the accessory is closed or ICONPAGE's window is topped.
    While in the background, keypresses are ignored by ICONPAGE. Menu items
    are also ignored but the menu title will be set back to normal.
 *  ICONPAGE always displays an icon in a set of three (ie a group). When
    displaying single icon files (.IBI) the single icon is displayed in the
    first position of the set and the other two are shown as shaded boxes
    indicating that it is a single icon file.
 *  Menu selections [*.IBI] [*.IB3] and [*.IB*] will change the extension
    to your desired choice and then perform a new folder search. You are
    given the file_selector again, showing the same path as you left it.
    A simple <Return> or click on [Ok] will quickly pick the same path
    again if you want to use that same path.
 *  SORT, like the IBx menu items mentioned above, will perform a new
    folder search (unless [Cancel] is selected).
