LISP INTERPRETER

  The LISP interpreter was something that I had written in Pascal in 1980,
and was translated (quickly) into C this year. There are many features that
have been left out, the most important being garbage collection, but the
interpreter supports a decent subset of LISP. All of the basic LISP features
are in it, including funargs, progs, and boolean operators. A test program
is included in this package, so you can see that the interpreter actually
works. To invoke it, just type "lisp < lisptest".

  There is a file called "lisplib" which contains some library functions.
When the interpreter starts up, it loads the library in. The library just
consists of LISP functions, so you may feel free to add to or subtract from
it.

  The source code is included, so you can modify the code to work better, add
new features, fix bugs, etc. I only request that if you perform any changes
to the code, that you inform me of them so I can fix my code as well. If you
need to ask any questions, or know why I did something in the code, you can
write to me at the above address. I haven't looked at the code in a while,
but I'll be glad to help in any way I can.

  There is no documentation included, as I am assuming that anyone who uses
this is familiar with LISP. There are many good books for those who want to
learn. To find out what functions and operators the interpreter supports,
I direct you to the code.

  My thanks to the Railroad BBS of Long Island, my initiator into the rites
